  abstract = {A general formalism developed few years ago to model polytropic Newtonian stars with anisotropic pressure is applied to model stars for which, both, radial and tangential pressure satisfy polytropic equations of state. We obtain the corresponding Lane--Emden equation, and integrate it for a wide range of values of the parameters, thereby illustrating the effects of the pressure anisotropy on stellar objects. We calculate Chandrasekhar mass for a white dwarf and compare it with previous results. Finally, prospective applications to some astrophysical scenarios are discussed.},

  abstract = {The equation of state inside very compact objects like neutron stars is still largely unkown. Even though a lot progress has been made in recent years to develop the so-called realistic equations of state, a lot of insight can be gained by using polytropic equations of state to integrate the stellar equations of structure. In this work we provide a brief review of the Newtonian and relativistic equations of structure and present some numerical results, which we believe that can be useful for students starting to work on this field. The internal structure of the Newtonian polytropes is obtained by the numerical integration of the Lane-Emden equation, and we used our results which can also be used to study the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs. However, Newtonian physics cannot correctly describe very compact and massive objects. There is an upper mass limit for neutron stars, supported by observations, which is not predicted by the Newtonian equations. Neutron stars are best described under the framework of General Relativity. The introduction of the TOV equations (as well as the relativistic Lane-Emden equations) is, therefore, necessary to correctly identify stable and non-stable models via the mass-radius relation. The analysis of the EoS also becomes relevant to discard models that allow a possible violation of causality (sound speed larger than c).},

  abstract = {The concept of neutron star maximum mass is revisited. In particular we show that when the dynamical processes occuring in the first few seconds after the neutron star birth are considered, the concept of neutron star maximum mass, as introduced by Oppenheimer and Volkoff, is partially inadequate. We show that both the maximum mass concept and the final stages of the evolution of massive stars depend on the composition of the neutron star material. In particular, we find two different scenarios depending on the absence or presence of negatively charged hadrons among the constituents. In the first scenario, we show that the Oppenheimer Volkoff mass M\_OV\_ does not represent the boundary between the value of the masses of neutron stars and black holes. In fact, we find a mass range in which both a neutron star and a black hole may exist. In the second scenario we show that, contrary to the standard view, it is possible to have a supernova explosion (accompained by nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission) followed by the delayed formation of a black hole. The latter mechamism could explain the lack of any observational evidence for a neutron star in the remnant of the supernova 1987A.},

  abstract = {The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov [TOV] equation constrains the internal structure of general relativistic static perfect fluid spheres. We develop several "solution generating" theorems for the TOV, whereby any given solution can be "deformed" to a new solution. Because the theorems we develop work directly in terms of the physical observables -- pressure profile and density profile -- it is relatively easy to check the density and pressure profiles for physical reasonableness. This work complements our previous article [Phys. Rev. D71 (2005) 124307; gr-qc/0503007] wherein a similar "algorithmic" analysis of the general relativistic static perfect fluid sphere was presented in terms of the spacetime geometry -- in the present analysis the pressure and density are primary and the spacetime geometry is secondary. In particular, our "deformed" solutions to the TOV equation are conveniently parameterized in terms of delta rho\_c and delta p\_c, the finite shift in the central density and central pressure. We conclude by presenting a new physical and mathematical interpretation of the TOV equation -- as an integrability condition on the density and pressure profiles.},

A minimal theorem appropriate to the relativistic domain is derived for the central pressure, corresponding to a well-known classical result. Inequalities involving the proper energy and the potential energy are also considered, as is the introduction of the physical radius in place of the coordinate radius. A singularity-free elementary algebraic solution of the field equations is presented and exact values obtained from it compared with the limits prescribed by some of the inequalities. In Part II an answer is given to the question whether the total amount of radiation emitted during the symmetrical gravitational contraction of an amount of matter whose initial energy, at complete dispersion, is W0 can ever exceed W0.},

In addition to these results, the text illustrates techniques involving simple topological arguments, fixed point theorems, and basic facts of functional analysis. Unlike many texts, which supply only the standard simplified theorems, this book presents the basic theory of ODEs in a general way. This SIAM reissue of the 1982 second edition covers invariant manifolds, perturbations, and dichotomies, making the text relevant to current studies of geometrical theory of differential equations and dynamical systems. In particular, Ordinary Differential Equations includes the proof of the Hartman-Grobman theorem on the equivalence of a nonlinear to a linear flow in the neighborhood of a hyperbolic stationary point, as well as theorems on smooth equivalences, the smoothness of invariant manifolds, and the reduction of problems on ODEs to those on \&quot;maps\&quot; (Poincar?). Audience: readers should have knowledge of matrix theory and the ability to deal with functions of real variables.},

Nonlinearity makes finding explicit solutions of TOV systems very difficult and such solutions and very rare. In this paper we introduce the notion of pseudo-asymptotic TOV systems and we show that the space of such systems is at least fifteen-dimensional. We also show that if the system is defined in a suitable domain (meaning the extended real line), then well-behaved pseudo-asymptotic TOV systems are genuine TOV systems in that domain, ensuring the existence of new fourteen analytic solutions for extended TOV equations. The solutions are classified according to the nature of the matter (ordinary or exotic) and to the existence of cavities and singularities. It is shown that at least three of them are realistic, in the sense that they are formed only by ordinary matter and contain no cavities or singularities.},

  abstract = {The radiative and particulate loss of mass by the Sun, -9.13*10\^-14 Solar masses per year or more causes the orbits of the planets to expand at the same rate, and their periods to lengthen at twice this rate. Unfortunately, under the present definition of the Astronomical Unit (AU) based on the fixed Gaussian gravity constant kGS = 0.01720209895 (AU)\^1.5/day, the value AUmet of the AU in meters must decrease at 1/3 this rate, all these rates being expressed logarithmically. The progress of the planets along their orbits slows quadratically with time. For example, in one century Mercury would lag behind the position predicted using constant solar mass by almost 1.4 km, in two centuries 5.5 km. The value of AUmet can be made constant by redefining it, based on a reference solar mass unit, such as the solar mass at J2000; else, the solar Gaussian gravity constant kGS used in defining the AU could be redefined proportional to the square root of the solar mass. Improved accuracy of the ephemerides would impose useful bounds on losses due to axion emission (Sikivie 2005). With no axion emission the Earth's semi-major axis grows 1.37 m/cy; with the maximum allowable such emission the result is 1.57 m/cy. Under reasonable assumptions about alternate gravity theories, radar delay data are used to show that the effect of a changing Newtonian gravity constant is negligible.},

This class of problems contains, in particular, a number of reaction-diffusion systems which arise in various mathematical models, especially in chemistry, physics and biology. The first two chapters introduce to the field and enable the reader to get acquainted with the main ideas by studying simple model problems, respectively of elliptic and parabolic type. The subsequent three chapters are devoted to problems with more complex structure; namely, elliptic and parabolic systems, equations with gradient depending nonlinearities, and nonlocal equations. They include many developments which reflect several aspects of current research. Although the techniques introduced in the first two chapters provide efficient tools to attack some aspects of these problems, they often display new phenomena and specifically different behaviors, whose study requires new ideas. Many open problems are mentioned and commented. The book is self-contained and up-to-date, it has a high didactic quality. It is devoted to problems that are intensively studied but have not been treated so far in depth in the book literature. The intended audience includes graduate and postgraduate students and researchers working in the field of partial differential equations and applied mathematics.},

And by physics I mean -- well, physics, what physicists mean by physics, i.e., the actual study of physical objects ... (rather than the study of symplectic structures on cotangent bundles, for example). In addition to presenting the advanced physics, which mathematicians find so easy, I also want to explore the workings of elementary physics ... which I have always found so hard to fathom.As these remarks probably reveal, basically I have written this work in order to learn the subject myself, in a form that I find comprehensible. And readers familiar with some of my previous books probably realize that this has pretty much been the reason for those works also. ...Perhaps this travelogue of an innocent abroad in a very different field will also turn out to be a book that mathematicians will like.},
