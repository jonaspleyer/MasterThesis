\begin{subsection}{Comparing TOV and LE results with a polytropic EOS}
In this section the numerical solutions of the TOV equation
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &= 4\pi\rho r^2\label{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1}\\
	\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} &=-\frac{m\rho}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{p}{\rho}\right)\left(\frac{4\pi r^3p}{m}+1\right)\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}
	\label{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2}
\end{align}
as derived previously in \ref{3-Mass-TOVDerivation} will be discussed. To obtain numerical solvability a equation of state in the form $\rho(r,p)$ is supplied. 
% TODO Add reference for when the equations are solvable
In Figure \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS} a plot of such a solution is presented.
The density $\rho$ is derived via the equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1} and the integration is done with a 4th order Runge-Kutta Method. The integration is stopped once the pressure reaches values $p\leq0$. The initial value of \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1} is $\partial m/\partial r(r=0)=0$. For \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1}, the initial value can be calculated when applying L'Hôpital's rule and combining them to obtain
\begin{alignat}{5}
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &&=\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{1} &&= 0\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r^2} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{2r}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r}  &&= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{2r} &&= 0\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r^3} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{3r^2}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &&=\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{3r^2} &&= \frac{4\pi\rho_0}{3}\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} &= 0
\end{alignat}
Explicit code can be found in \cite{pleyerGithubRepositoryJonas}. The Lane-Emden equation was obtained in section \ref{3-Mass-LEDerivation} as the non-relativistic limit of the TOV equation by neglecting terms of order $1/c^2$ and higher and setting $G=c=1$. To obtain numerical results for the LE equation as given in equation \ref{3-Mass-Lane-Emden-Eq}, a substitution of the form $d\theta/d\xi=\chi$ was used.
\begin{alignat}{3}
	\frac{d\theta}{d\xi} &= \chi &\hspace{1cm} \left.\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\right|_{\xi=0} &= 0\\
	\frac{d\chi}{d\xi} &= -\frac{2}{\xi}\chi-\theta^n & \left.\frac{d\chi}{d\xi}\right|_{\xi=0} &= -\theta^n
	\label{4-NumSol-LE-Substitution}
\end{alignat}
where the initial value for $d\chi/d\xi$ can be calculated with L'Hôpital's rule. With the conversion factor $\alpha$ derived in section \ref{3-Mass-LEDerivation}, TOV and LE results can be compared. Figure \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS} shows the solution of both equations for the parameters of table \ref{4-NumSol-TOVParameters}. Note that values in the last part are calculated instead of supplied to the solving routine. Additionally conversion equations to compare TOV and LE results are displayed.\\
Since the mass reads
\begin{equation}
	m(r) = \int\limits_0^r 4\pi s^2\rho(s)ds,
\end{equation}
we expect $\partial m/\partial r(R)=0$ if $p(R)=0$ when choosing a polytropic equation of state with $\gamma>0$. The plot in figure \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS} shows this expected behaviour for the Lane Emden equation at $r\approx2.31$ and has the same behaviour for the TOV results at $r\approx6.80$.\footnote{For the purpose of nicely displaying the calculated result, the plot only shows result up to $r=2.5$}

\begin{subsection}{Verifying the results}
Verification is done in different ways. First, one can compare calculated LE results with already known exact  solutions for certain exponents as given in table \ref{3-Mass-LE-Exact-Results}. All calculations are carried out with a chosen step size of $d\xi=0.03$.\\
The graphs overall show good numerical agreement. Initial values at $r=0$ are identical since they were set to be. The spike occurring afterwards can be explained by equation \ref{4-NumSol-LE-Substitution}. The initial value of all derivatives is identically $0$ which means no change of value for $\theta$ or $\chi$ for the initial step. It is clear that the relative difference on the right hand side will spike again once smaller values for $\theta$ are reached if the absolute difference stays constant. This behaviour is best seen in the solution for $n=5$ where a large range of $0\leq r\leq100$ for solving was chosen. The offset between the numerically calculated values and the exact result stays constant while the value of $\theta$ decreases exponentially.

% TODO TOV-Terms: Why do we do this? Explain it better.
Next, we wish to see how accurate numerical TOV results are. This is not an easy task since no explicit solutions are known for the TOV equation. However one way to at least get confident that solving was a success is by dropping terms from right to left in equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2} and solving for these new differential equations. As we have seen in section \ref{3-Mass-LEDerivation}, the last result should reproduce the LE equation. These intermediate differential equations have been numerically solved and results can be seen in figure \ref{4-NumSol-TovTerms}.

	\caption[Comparison of LE and partial TOV solutions]{Comparison of LE and partial TOV solutions - The index $i$ represents the number of terms still present in the equation where $i=3$ means the complete TOV equation and $i=0$ the LE equation. The last figure shows the difference between the TOV solution with $0$ terms and the LE solution calculated via equation \ref{4-NumSol-LE-Substitution}. The scale of the difference shows a maximum of $\approx3.5\times10^{-7}$. In order to achieve such a comparison, a polynomial fit of both pressure solutions had to be done. This should however not alter the result in any noticeable way. For further details see \cite{pleyerGithubRepositoryJonas}.}

\begin{subsection}{Relativistic EOS}
In the previous discussion, we relied on the EOS given by \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS}. This is a versatile assumption, but one could ask, what would happen to a star in which the particles have no interaction but are near relativistic speed. The resulting EOS was calculated in the beginning \ref{2-IntEner-FinalEOS} although not written down explicitly. Since explicit inversion of the given function is hard, we rely on numerical methods for calculation.
