\begin{subsection}{Polytropic EOS}
In this section the numerical solutions of the TOV equation
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &= 4\pi\rho r^2\label{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1}\\
	\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} &=-\frac{m\rho}{r^2}\left(1+\frac{p}{\rho}\right)\left(\frac{4\pi r^3p}{m}+1\right)\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{-1}
	\label{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2}
\end{align}
as derived previously in \ref{3-Mass-TOVDerivation} will be discussed. To obtain numerical solvability a equation of state in the form $\rho(r,p)$ is supplied. 
% TODO Add reference for when the equations are solvable
In Figure \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS} a plot of such a solution is presented.
The density $\rho$ is derived via the equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1} and the integration is done with a 4th order Runge-Kutta Method. The integration is stopped once the pressure reaches values $p\leq0$. The initial value of \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1} is $\partial m/\partial r(r=0)=0$. For \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1}, the initial value can be calculated when applying L'HÃ´pital's and combining them to obtain
\begin{alignat}{3}
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &=\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{1} &= 0\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r^2} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{2r}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r}  &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{2r} &= 0\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{m}{r^3} &= \lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{3r^2}\frac{\partial m}{\partial r} &=\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{4\pi\rho r^2}{3r^2} &= \frac{4\pi\rho_0}{3}\\
	\lim\limits_{r\rightarrow0}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} &= 0
\end{alignat}
Explicit code can be found in \cite{pleyerGithubRepositoryJonas}. Upon comparing the TOV equation and its non-relativistic limiting case, the Lane-Emden equation\footnote{Neglecting terms of order $1/c^2$ and higher and setting $G=c=1$.} as derived in \ref{3-Mass-LEDerivation},
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} = -\frac{m\rho}{r^2}
\end{equation}
one could be tempted to make the assumption that
% TODO Make this more clear. The reader should not see this equation as prominently but should still know why this does not work.
$\frac{\partial p_{\text{TOV}}}{dr} \leq \frac{\partial p_{\text{LE}}}{dr}.$
However this equation fails since the mass given in equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic1} is not the same as the one given in the LE equation.\\
% This means that if the Lane-Emden equation has value of $p_\text{LE}=0$, the TOV equation will also have one, and if $p_\text{LE}(0)\neq0$ then $r_\text{0,TOV}<r_\text{0,LE}$. However depending on the equation of state, this may not be said with regard to the density $\rho_\text{TOV}$ as can be seen in the numerical example below.
Figure \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS} shows the solution of both equations for the parameters:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
		\hline
		Parameters & Values \\
		\hline
		Equation of state & $\rho=Ap^{1/\gamma}$ \\
		$A$ & $2$\\
		$n$ & $3$\\
		$\gamma=1+\frac{1}{n}$ & $4/3$ \\
		$p_0$ & $0.5$ \\
		$\rho_0=Ap_0^{1/\gamma}$ & $2(2)^{\frac{4}{3}}\approx1.1892$\\
		$m_0$ & $0$\\

	\label{4-NumSol-TOVParameters}
\end{table}
In this particular case $1<\gamma=4/3$ and thus the slope of the TOV-density does not necessarily have to be smaller. By taking the derivative of the density with respect to the equation of state one sees that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial r} = \frac{\rho^{\gamma^{-1}-1}}{C^{1/\gamma}}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}
\end{equation}
and thus if $\rho$ has small enough values that the slope of the TOV-density may falls below the Lane-Emden solution. The plot of this particular case shows this small detail at the last part of the plotted interval.

The images show the plots for the parameters of table \ref{4-NumSol-TOVParameters}. First the pressure is presented. Afterwards the density calculated with the given EOS and the average density $\bar{\rho}_i=(4\pi/3)^{-1}m_i/r^3$ for the two solutions are beeing compared. In the second row, the mass and the ratio $m_i/r$ can be seen.}
	\label{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS}
\end{figure}\noindent
Generally speaking this result shows the expected behaviour. One has to keep in mind that due to numerical errors, the point at which the respective solutions for $p$ cross the $x$-axis can not be determined perfectly. This issue is especially prominent for the TOV equation, since the function tends towards $0$ very slowly.\\
A manifest of this behaviour can also be seen at the end of the slope of the TOV-Mass $m_{\text{TOV}}$. Since
\begin{equation}
	m(r) = \int\limits_0^r 4\pi s^2\rho(s)ds,
\end{equation}
we expect $\partial m/\partial r(R)=0$ for the given polytropic equation of state \ref{4-NumSol-TOVParameters} with parameter $\gamma>0$. The plot does not perfectly show this expected behaviour which can again be traced back to numerical uncertainties as discussed earlier.
%Since the metric outside the star is expected to have the Schwarzschild metric, we must demand $m(r)=M=\text{const}$ for $r\geq R$. And since the derivative of the mass vanishes at $R$, we have a (at least) $C^1$ mass function $m(r)$ which is indeed required by assumption. By equation \ref{3-Mass-EinstEqu-2}, we see that the pressure needs to be at least continuous to yield a $C^1$ metric. This is indeed satisfied if $p(R)=0$. Additionally from equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2}, we can see that $\partial p/\partial r(R)=0$ (again for the polytropic equation of state) which shows that $\e^\nu$ is $C^2$ at $R$ and thus since solutions of \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2} are smooth on $(0,R)$, $\e^\nu$ is at least $C^2$ on $\R_{>0}$.
A cross check to test if the limiting case as calculated in section \ref{3-Mass-LEDerivation} by dropping all additional terms in equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2} yields good results. Additionally, when dropping terms from right to left in equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2} more intermediate solutions can be numerically calculated. Results can be seen in figure \ref{4-NumSol-TovTerms}.

	\caption[Comparison LE and partial TOV]{Comparison between the LE and TOV solutions while dropping terms from equation \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqBasic2} from right to left. The last figure shows the difference between the TOV solution with 0 terms and the LE solution. The scale of the difference shows that the numerical differ only by values up to $3.5\times10^{-7}$. In order to achieve such a comparison, a polynomial fit of both pressure solutions had to be done. This should however not alter the result in any noticeable way. For further details see \cite{pleyerGithubRepositoryJonas}.}

\begin{subsection}{Relativistic EOS}
In the previous discussion, we relied on the EOS given by \ref{4-NumSol-TOVEqEasyEOS}. This is a versatile assumption, but one could ask, what would happen to a star in which the particles have no interaction but are near relativistic speed. The resulting EOS was calculated in the beginning \ref{2-IntEner-FinalEOS} although not written down explicitly. Since explicit inversion of the given function is hard, we rely on numerical methods for calculation.
