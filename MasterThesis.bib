  abstract = {The equation of state inside very compact objects like neutron stars is still largely unkown. Even though a lot progress has been made in recent years to develop the so-called realistic equations of state, a lot of insight can be gained by using polytropic equations of state to integrate the stellar equations of structure. In this work we provide a brief review of the Newtonian and relativistic equations of structure and present some numerical results, which we believe that can be useful for students starting to work on this field. The internal structure of the Newtonian polytropes is obtained by the numerical integration of the Lane-Emden equation, and we used our results which can also be used to study the Chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs. However, Newtonian physics cannot correctly describe very compact and massive objects. There is an upper mass limit for neutron stars, supported by observations, which is not predicted by the Newtonian equations. Neutron stars are best described under the framework of General Relativity. The introduction of the TOV equations (as well as the relativistic Lane-Emden equations) is, therefore, necessary to correctly identify stable and non-stable models via the mass-radius relation. The analysis of the EoS also becomes relevant to discard models that allow a possible violation of causality (sound speed larger than c).},

  abstract = {The concept of neutron star maximum mass is revisited. In particular we show that when the dynamical processes occuring in the first few seconds after the neutron star birth are considered, the concept of neutron star maximum mass, as introduced by Oppenheimer and Volkoff, is partially inadequate. We show that both the maximum mass concept and the final stages of the evolution of massive stars depend on the composition of the neutron star material. In particular, we find two different
scenarios depending on the absence or presence of negatively charged hadrons among the constituents. In the first scenario, we show that the Oppenheimer Volkoff mass M\_OV\_ does not represent the boundary between the value of the masses of neutron stars and black holes. In fact, we find a mass range in which both a neutron star and a black hole may exist. In the second scenario we show that, contrary to the standard view, it is possible to have a supernova explosion (accompained by nucleosynthesis and neutrino emission) followed by the delayed formation of a black hole. The latter mechamism could explain the lack of any observational evidence for a neutron star in the remnant of the
supernova 1987A.},

  abstract = {In Part I of this paper certain well known results concerning the Schwarzschild interior solution are generalized to more general static fluid spheres in the form of inequalities comparing the boundary value of g44 with certain expressions involving only the mass concentration and the ratio of the central energy density to the central pressure. A minimal theorem appropriate to the relativistic domain is derived for the central pressure, corresponding to a well-known classical result. Inequalities involving the proper energy and the potential energy are also considered, as is the introduction of the physical radius in place of the coordinate radius. A singularity-free elementary algebraic solution of the field equations is presented and exact values obtained from it compared with the limits prescribed by some of the inequalities. In Part II an answer is given to the question whether the total amount of radiation emitted during the symmetrical gravitational contraction of an amount of matter whose initial energy, at complete dispersion, is W0 can ever exceed W0.},

It is only necessary for me to explain what I mean by a mathematician, and what I mean byphysics.By a mathematician I mean some one who has been trained in modern mathematics and been inculcated with its general outlook. ... And by physics I mean -- well, physics, what physicists mean by physics, i.e., the actual study of physical objects ... (rather than the study of symplectic structures on cotangent bundles, for example). In addition to presenting the advanced physics, which mathematicians find so easy, I also want to explore the workings of elementary physics ... which I have always found so hard to fathom.As these remarks probably reveal, basically I have written this work in order to learn the subject myself, in a form that I find comprehensible. And readers familiar with some of my previous books probably realize that this has pretty much been the reason for those works also. ...Perhaps this travelogue of an innocent abroad in a very different field will also turn out to be a book that mathematicians will like.},
